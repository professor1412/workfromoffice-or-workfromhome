# Work from Home Decision Prediction System

## Description
This project aims to predict an individual's preference for working from home based on various input parameters. The model takes the following input parameters:

- **Age**
- **Occupation**
- **Gender**
- **Same Office Home Location**
- **Kids**
- **RM Save Money**
- **RM Quality Time**
- **RM Better Sleep**
- **Calmer Stressed**
- **RM Professional Growth**
- **RM Lazy**
- **RM Productive**
- **Digital Connect Sufficient**
- **RM Better Work-Life Balance**
- **RM Improved Skillset**
- **RM Job Opportunities**

The output is a target value indicating the likelihood of an employee's desire to work from home.

## Key Features
- **Data Processing and Model Training**: Implemented comprehensive data preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare data for modeling. 
- **Supervised Learning Models**: Explored various supervised learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines, to optimize prediction accuracy.
- **Feature Engineering**: Utilized feature selection and engineering methods to enhance model performance by identifying the most impactful variables.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Applied cross-validation and various metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) to evaluate the effectiveness of the models.

## Technology Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - NumPy for numerical computations
  - Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning models
  - Streamlit for building the interactive web application
- **Version Control**: Git for source code management

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
